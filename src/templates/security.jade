        p Our site is served using TLS 1.1 and greater. NHANCE NOW hosts all data in secure SSAE 16 audited data centers on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure in USA, Germany and India. We will expand our data centers as and when needed to meet with region specific data compliance laws. We regularly conduct security audit services, ourselves or in partnership with third party service providers, to manage security threats.

        strong NHANCE NOW Architecture & Scalability
        b Scalability/Reliability of Architecture
        p NHANCE NOW uses Amazon Web Services (RDS & S3) to manage user data. The database is replicated synchronously so that we can quickly recover from a database failure. As an extra precaution, we take regular snapshots of the database and securely move them to a separate data center so that we can restore them elsewhere as needed, even in the event of a regional Amazon failure.
        strong Encrypted Transactions
        p Web connections to the NHANCE NOW service are via TLS 1.1 and above. We support forward secrecy and AES-GCM, and prohibit insecure connections using TLS 1.0 and below or RC4.

        b Employee Workstations, Laptops, & Mobile Devices
