In addition to this customers pay a nominal one time fee for every Digital Kit that is issued. We generate an invoice at the end of each month which displays the Monthly Usage Fee slab considered for the month and the number of Digital Kits issued and the price for each Digital Kit. The price of Digital Kit is determined based on the industry segment that you belong to.

                  .pricing__questions__block__text
                    div We have a simple pricing model. We charge a fixed Monthly Platform Usage Fee which is based on a slab pricing. Slabs are customised for every customer. In addition to this customers pay a nominal one time fee for every Digital Kit that is issued. We generate an invoice at the end of each month which displays the Monthly Usage Fee slab considered for the month and the number of Digital Kits issued and the price for each Digital Kit. The price of Digital Kit is determined based on the industry segment that you belong to.
